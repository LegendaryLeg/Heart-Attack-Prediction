# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart attacks using a dataset from Kaggle. To make predictions, a Machine Learning model was created using the Decision Tree algorithm. The model is then exported into Power BI to show the prediction on the data. The Power BI project shows relationships of different features from the dataset and how it affects the final prediction using graphs and figures.
